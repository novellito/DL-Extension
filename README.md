## DL-Frequent-Flyers

An autofill chrome extension I made for work. It helps speed up the process of creating tickets for our IT system.

The extension uses Twitter's <a href="https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js">typeahead.js</a> for the autofill profiles.

To use: Simple download the file and drag the folder into your chrome extensions directory
(chrome://extensions/)

## DL-File-Deleter

An electron application created to help delete massive amounts of legacy content from our old course sites since it did not have a feature that let you delete all of the content at once. The project originally started our as a simple script in Node.js, but since I was graduating I decided to make an easy to use GUI for everyone to use at work.

This was made using the [Selenium webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) with Node.js and [electron.](https://github.com/electron/electron)
