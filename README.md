# DL-Frequent-Flyers

An autofill chrome extension I made for work. It helps speed up the process of creating tickets for our IT system.

The extension uses Twitter's <a href="https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js">typeahead.js</a> for the autofill profiles.

To use: Simple download the file and drag the folder into your [chrome://extensions/](chrome extensions directory).
