      <b>IMPORTANT: delete files and folders separately!</b>
      <p>Note: If there are a lot of files or folders being deleted, enter an amount less than the total number of files/folders. In other words, don't enter an amount
        greater than the number of files/folders you want to delete or else the application will crash.
      </p>
      <p>Enter course url, username, password, and either # folders / # files <b>(only one!)</b></p>
      <p>ex: Fill out # folders and click run. Once this finishes, make sure to click save in the browser. Clear your entry for # folders, and then you can enter # files to delete and click run</p>
      <p>Once the browser has opened up the section with all the files and folders, <b>it will take about 10 seconds for the files to start getting deleted.</b></p>
      <p>The browser will automatically close after 2 minutes so make sure to hit save</b></p>
      <p>If something breaks just restart the application :)</p>
